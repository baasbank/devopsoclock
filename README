## INSTALLING TERRAFORM
Simplest way is to use tfenv https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv
- brew install tfenv
- tfenv to check your installation - you should see a version
- tfenv install <terraform version e.g 1.4.6>
- tfenv list = lists all installed version
- tfenv use <terraform version e.g 1.4.5> to use a particular version



Assignment: 
1. Replace values with variables when they are used more than once
2. break things up into different logical files - providers.tf, cloudrun.tf
3. Create a service account called cloudrun-service-account
4. Make cloud run use that service account instead of the default service account
